# Delayed Teleoperation Demo
A modified version of the "shapes" example from Chai3D using Boost C++ libraries to demonstrate the impact of constant delay in teleoperation. Tested with the Firewire version of Sensable Technologies PHANTOM Omni(R).

## How to use

| Controls        | Actions     | 
| :-------------: |:-------------:| 
| +     | Increase latency | 
| -       | Decrease latency | 

## Known Issues
* When you concanstly press the + or - keys to increase/decrease delay, the program sometimes crashes.

## Ways to improve it
* Fix known Issues (duh!)
* Implement stability control algorithms
* Suggest ways to improve it
